MapStruct is a Java-based code generation library that simplifies the process of mapping between Java beans or POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects). Instead of writing the mapping code manually, MapStruct generates it at compile time, saving time and reducing the likelihood of errors.

Here are some of the benefits of using MapStruct:

Reduction of boilerplate code: MapStruct eliminates the need for writing repetitive mapping code, which can be error-prone and time-consuming.

Type-safe: MapStruct generates type-safe code that ensures that the types of the source and target objects are compatible. This reduces the likelihood of runtime errors caused by type mismatches.

Easy to use: MapStruct is easy to use and has a low learning curve. It integrates with popular Java frameworks and can be used with a variety of Java development environments.

Customizable: MapStruct provides the ability to customize the generated mapping code using annotations, custom methods, and other advanced features. This allows developers to fine-tune the mapping process to their specific requirements.

Performance: MapStruct generates highly optimized code that is fast and efficient. This makes it suitable for use in high-performance applications.

Overall, MapStruct is a powerful tool that can save developers time and effort, reduce errors, and improve the maintainability of Java code.
